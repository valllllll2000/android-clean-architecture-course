# android-clean-architecture-course

This is the course code for the Clean Architecture and SOLID principles for Android in Kotlin course on udemy by https://www.udemy.com/user/catalinstefan2

I have modified a few things as the original code (see https://github.com/CatalinStefan/MemoryNotesKotlin) was a bit outdated but all credits to the course creator https://github.com/CatalinStefan, I have only made sure that the code works with the latest Android tools. A few additions:
* Using one of the latest dagger versions
* Using the versions catalog: https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs
* Using ksp instead of kapt: https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp
* Using Kotlin DSL instead of Groovy: https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-kotlin-dsl
* Latest versions of all the libraries
* Using the new menu provider: https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/MenuProvider

If I have time, I will migrate to Compose, just for the fun of it.
